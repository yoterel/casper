Instructions:
You re going to participate in a study that tries to quantify how latency in projection mapping can be perceptually reduced.
We will run several session, where in each session you will be presented with several trials.
in each trial, you will see two videos of a hand moving, and a projection applied to it.
Please choose which one seems to have more latency to it by clicking either button 1 or button 2.
Remember to select the video with MORE latency ("lag").

We will start with a training session, where latency is obvious.
