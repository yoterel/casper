pilot:
	speeds:  (texture = uv)
			0.5, 1.1, 1.7, 2.3, 3.0
	contrasts:  (texture = uv)
			0.4 / 0.6 / 0.8
	6 textures
		textures:
			random_colors, dragon, cursive2, birds, uv, brick
	notes from pilot:
		latencies are much lower than expected
		prepare proper excel sheet
		blur image? report time it took
		shorten videos...
full:
	2 textures, 3 conditions (nothing, jfa, jfa-uv)


Get subjects full name, age, and gender, if they watched pm before, if they wear glasses

Instructions:
You re going to participate in a study that tries to quantify how latency in projection mapping can be perceptually reduced.
We will run several session, where in each session you will be presented with several trials.
in each trial, you will see two videos of a hand moving, and a projection applied to it.
Please choose which one seems to have more latency to it by clicking either button 1 or button 2.
Remember to select the video with MORE latency ("lag").
We will start with a training session, where latency is obvious.

open excel sheet, input subject name, age
General -> Use Projector

Record & Playback -> Recording Name -> all / translation
Record & Playback -> Video playback speed -> select speed
Record & Playback -> Mixer ratio -> select mixture ratio
Record & Playback -> Initial Latency -> 40.0f

Record & Playback -> Initial Latency -> 10.0f
< START EXPERIMENT >
Record & Playback -> Run user study
< END EXPERIMENT >
Write final JND in excel
repeat from step 6

final quesitons:
did you figure out the experimental protocol ?
did you have a stratedgy to figure out the latency ?
