Get subjects full name, age, and gender, if they watched pm before, if they wear glasses

Instructions:
You re going to participate in a study that tries to quantify how latency in projection mapping can be perceptually reduced.
We will run 3 "sessions", one for training, and two for testing, where in each session you will be presented with several "trial".
in each trial, you will see two videos of a hand moving, and a projection applied to it.
Please choose which one seems to have more latency to it by clicking either button 1 or button 2.
Remember to select the video with MORE latency ("lag").

We will start with a training session. But before that please observe how high latency looks like, vs how low latency looks like.

steps:
ahand.exe --simcam --mesh ../../resource/UserStudy.fbx --mode user_study
open excel sheet, input subject name, age, have they seen dynamic projection mapping before, glasses

Write final JNDs in excel

final quesitons after each session:
1) which part did you tend to focus on? (center of hand, fingers, edges between hand and background, no specific part, other)
2) are your eyes fatigued? (1 - no, 2 - slightly, 3 - yes)

final question:
if you had to decide what looks better which one would you choose? (show expected latency with/without JND)
