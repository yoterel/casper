Instructions:
purpose:
You are going to participate in a study that comapares two methods of dynamically projecting onto hands. 

gameplay:
each session consists of 20 rounds of the guessing game.
In this game, you need to bend one of four fingers according to the character in the middle of the hand

sessions:
We will run with as many sessions as we can, where the first ~20% will be training.
each sessions takes about 1 minute.
for each method, you will do a session for back and front hand.
a session ends when a smiley appears.

questions:
between sessions:
"How difficult was it to spot the correct character?" 1-5
"how tired is your hand?" 1-5

final questions:
lastly i will ask you:
"which method do you find more visually appealing?" 1st / 2nd
"which hand position was more comfortable?" front / back


score:
You will be scored by accuracy and time it took to bend finger.

tips:
try finding a good location for the hand and keeping it there.
the leap losses track sometimes. bring your arm upwards to continue playing.
bend the fingers "strongly" to choose a response.
it is better to be sure about the character (accuracy > time)
if you can't see a character, you can wait a bit, or deduce from the other fingers...
use only left hand
don't block the hand with your head.
